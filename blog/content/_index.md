[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) framework for Web Testing and Automation that enables cross-browser testing acrpss [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) _with a single API_ -- 
simplifying the developer experience and workflows for end-to-end testing of modern web apps.

What is cross-browser testing? Why is test automation important to modern web app developers? How can Playwright help us design and execute effective end-to-end testing workflows? And what does Playwright do differently when compared to existing testing frameworks? This blog documents my learning journey exploring these questions starting with [#30DaysOfPlaywright](about/#my-30daysofplaywright-quickstart).
