[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) Node.js library to automate cross-browser testing for [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) _with a single API_,
simplifying the developer experience and workflows for end-to-end testing of modern web apps.

But - what is cross-browser testing? Why is test automation important to modern web app developers? How can Playwright help us design and execute effective testing strategies and automation? This blog documents my learning journey as I explore these questions and more starting with [#30DaysOfPlaywright](about/#my-30daysofplaywright-quickstart). Join me!
