This is a blog to document my learning journey into [Cross-browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing) and [Test Automation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Automated_testing) -- with a focus on exploring [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) as my tool of choice for hands-on experimentation. My goals are:

* Learn core fundamentals for end-to-end testing
* Explore Playwright for automated cross-browser testing
* Understand best practices for modern web testing
* Share my learning in a structured way to help others
