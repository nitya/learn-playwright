## A #30Days Journey

This starts my #30Days exploration of web automation and end-to-end testing for modern web apps, using the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) library and API. What I hope to learn over the next month or so:

 * Core concepts and terminology for web automation
 * Playwright features and API
 * Code tutorials from quickstart to advanced usage
 * Best practices, real-world examples (community-driven)
 * Relevant resources for self-study (join me!)

Good tasks to target for `Day 001`

 - [ ] Check [Playwright Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) 
 - [ ] Read [Why Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/why-playwright#support-for-all-browsers)
 - [ ] Complete [Getting Started](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) tutorial.
 - [ ] Watch [What's New In Playwright v1.15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwzsDeEj7Y)

## What is Playwright?

By [definition](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firebox and WebKit with a single API -- supporting cross-browser web automation that is `ever-green, capable, reliable, and fast`.

**Headless execution** is supported for all browsers, on all platforms. This currently includes Linux, macOS and Windows.

To use Playwright, install with `npm i 0


## How do I use Playwright?

For web _test automation_, use the built-in test runner ([Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)) or integrate with [third-party test runner](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-runners) using the [Playwright library](https://playwright.dev/docs/library) and a few lines of code. The [Playwright API](https://playwright.dev/docs/languages) is currently available for Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and .NET languages!
