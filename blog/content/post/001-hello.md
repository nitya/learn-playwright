This is the first in the series of posts to document my learning journey with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) - an open-source library and support tools ecosystem to enable cross-browser testing and web automation for modern web apps.

Learn more about my this project [here](../about).


## Motivation

Modern web app development is complicated. Users will access web apps from diverse device form factors (mobile, tablet, wearable, television etc.) and browser platforms (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera, Firefox etc.) - _and expect to get a consistent user experience and correct application behavior_ across them.

To ensure this we need a comprehensive testing strategy with _cross-browser support_ (to validate user experience and data integrity across diverse platforms) and _automated testing_ (to scale ability to test scenarios at the frequency and granularity we need). How can we get started with this as developers?

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is an open-source Node.JS library and supporting tools ecosystem to empower automated cross-browser testing for modern web apps. It runs on all modern operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) with Java, .NET, JavaScript/TypeScript and Python API implementations to simplify integration.

## Learning Objectives

In this blog series, I want to explore the broader domain of end-to-end testing for modern web apps, then focus on using Playwright as the testing library and tooling ecosystem for hands-on experimentation. Learning objectives are:

* Learn: Cross-Browser + Automated Testing Fundamentals
* Learn: End-To-End Testing Scenarios + Challenges
* Learn: Playwright Library API and Tooling Support
* Explore: Playwright Usage for End-to-End Testing
* Explore: Playwright Challenges & Best Practices
* Explore: Other Modern Web App Testing Tools & Resources

## 30DaysOfPlaywright

This blog is intended as a long-term living resource to explore all things web automation and Playwright related. 

In the short-term, I plan to spend a month of dedicated time exploring the topics above. You can track my journey on Twitter with [#30DaysOfPlaywright](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2330DaysOfPlaywright&src=typed_query) or follow the series on dev.to with tag [#LearnPlaywright](https://dev.to/t/learnplaywright).

You can see the [proposed plan for study](https://github.com/nitya/learn-playwright/blob/main/README.md#30daysofplaywright) subject to changes as I dive deeper into each topic.


## Things To Do: Day 1

Want to join me? 

Here are a few tasks you can target for Day 1. Look out for my next post to learn how my Day 1 went.

- [X] Bookmark [Playwright Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) -- Star [Playwright Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)
- [X] Explore [Try.Playwright](https://tryplaywright.tech) in browser (nothing to install)
- [X] Complete [Getting Started](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) (install local dev env)
- [X] Watch [What's New In Playwright](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46Zj8pDH5tDosqm1gd7WTg/videos) - optional

Once this is done, we'll have validated our local testing environment and can jump into learning fundamental concepts related to cross-browser testing and automated testing workflows.
