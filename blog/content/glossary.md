Explains terms, acronyms or concepts used frequently in the test automation or Playwright contexts - that may not always be familiar to the learner. I'll link to these (as a canonical resource) from blog posts where those terms are used.

#### Evergreen

Used in context of [agile software development](https://blog.accessitautomation.com/evergreen-it-a-definition-in-less-than-100-words), it's about releasing small and frequent iterations of software (as opposed to traditional signature releases spread out over longer periods). Check out the Playwright [changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases) and [What's New In Playwright](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46Zj8pDH5tDosqm1gd7WTg) videos to get the highlights for each release.
