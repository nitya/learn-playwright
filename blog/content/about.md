Hello - [I'm Nitya!](#about-me) üëãüèΩ

This blog documents my learning journey into all things related to cross-browser testing, test automation and end-to-end testing for web and multi-platform apps using the [**Playwright**](https://playwright.dev) framework and tooling ecosystem.

I'm kicking things off in Dec 2021 with a [**#30DaysOfPlaywright**](#about-30daysofplaywright) content series where I'll everything from core testing concepts, to Playwright tools, APIs & best practices for end-to-end testing of modern web applications.

_Join me!_

### My #30DaysOfPlaywright Quickstart

Humans learn best when we have [urgency, repetition and association](http://gretchenschmelzer.com/blog-1/2015/1/11/understanding-learning-and-memory-the-neuroscience-of-repetition) in our learning process. Doing something focused over a non-trivial period of time (like #30Days) can help. So I planned a #30DaysOfPlaywright activity with these learning goals in mind:

 * Learn core concepts and best practices for end-to-end testing (general)
 * Learn the features, tools and API in the Playwright framework (specific)
 * Explore Playwright APIs in depth - understand capabilities & usage.
 * Explore Playwright Test runner - integration workflows & automation.
 * Explore Playwright Tools - for debugging and performance analysis.
 * Understand Testing Best Practices - testing scripts & app scenarios.

The list below provides a tentative schedule for topics - check back for updates with links to blog posts as they are published.

 * Dec 1, 2021 - [Hello, #30DaysOfPlaywright](../000-hello-30days)
