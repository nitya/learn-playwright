# Learn Playwright

Welcome to my learning journey into Web Test Automation with some emphasis on using the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) as the library/tool of choice for hands-on experimentation.

## Objectives

* Understand core concepts for web testing & automation
* Learn the key challenges & popular tools, techniques
* Explore Playwright as a cross-browser testing tool
* Learn best testing/automation practices for modern web development

Want to follow along? I'll be posting periodic updates on my journey in three locations:
 * [This blog](https://nitya.github.io/learn-playwright)
 * [Dev.to #Learn-Playwright tag](https://dev.to/t/learn-playwright)
 * [Twitter #30DaysOfPlaywright]() series

## #30DaysOfPlaywright

To give my learning journey some structure, and help others follow along, I created a tentative roadmap for a #30Days content series. The specific topics may change as I progress, to accomodate detours and deep-dives into topics I found interesting.
