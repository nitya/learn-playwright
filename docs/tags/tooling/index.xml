      <description>Welcome to Day 4 of #30DaysOfPlaywright!!
 In our last post we looked at how to setup a demo app as a real-world testbed for Playwright. See the source code and visit the running site for reference.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll kick off a series of &amp;ldquo;Tool Talk&amp;rdquo; blog posts that use this app as a sandbox to learn about the authoring, debugging, profiling, and command-line, tools provided by the Playwright framework.</description>
