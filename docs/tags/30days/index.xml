      <description>Welcome to Day 2 of #30DaysOfPlaywright!!
 We kicked off our Playwright exploration yesterday by completing Part 1 of the Playwright Getting Started tutorial focused on setting up and validating our local development environment for testing.
Today we&amp;rsquo;ll complete the second part of that tutorial focused on unpacking the Playwright Test scripts, learning fundamental Playwright concepts, and using them to write more complex tests. In today&amp;rsquo;s tasks, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover:</description>

      <description>Welcome to Day 1 of #30DaysOfPlaywright!!
 Today&amp;rsquo;s goal is to make progress on the Getting Started tutorial which should get us set up with the Playwright Test runner in our local development environment - and get us configured to do our first test run.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot covered in there, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to break this into multiple parts.
  Part 1: - Install the Playwright Test runner and validate setup by completing your first test run with the sample test script.</description>

The new year is just over 30 days away so it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect time to make a learning resolution, get started on it now - and then check it off the very first day of the New Year! So what do you want to learn this year?
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to invest this month exploring a topic that fascinates me - end-to-end testing for modern web apps.</description>
