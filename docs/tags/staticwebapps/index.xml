      <description>Welcome to Day 3 of #30DaysOfPlaywright!!
 Alright - so I got through the Getting Started tutorial and have the [Playwright Test] runner setup on my local environment. Where to next?
 About Azure Static Web Apps My original goal was to explore Playwright Test tools in Playwright, and dive deeper into command-line, authoring and debugging support in more detail. But it occured to me that doing this with a somewhat realistic app as an experiment sandbox, might make more sense.</description>
