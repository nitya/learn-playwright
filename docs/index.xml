      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Learn About Testing! It&amp;rsquo;s December 1! The new year is just over 30 days away so it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect time to make a learning resolution, get started on it now - and then check it off the very first day of the New Year! So what do you want to learn this year?
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to invest this month exploring a topic that fascinates me - end-to-end testing for modern web apps.</description>

      <description>Explains terms, acronyms or concepts used frequently in the test automation or Playwright contexts - that may not always be familiar to the learner. I&amp;rsquo;ll link to these (as a canonical resource) from blog posts where those terms are used.
 Evergreen Used in context of agile software development, it&amp;rsquo;s about releasing small and frequent iterations of software (as opposed to traditional signature releases spread out over longer periods). Check out the Playwright changelog and What&amp;rsquo;s New In Playwright videos to get the highlights for each release.</description>

This blog documents my learning journey into all things related to cross-browser testing, test automation and end-to-end testing for web and multi-platform apps using the Playwright library and tools ecosystem.
I&amp;rsquo;m kicking things off in Dec 2021 with a #30DaysOfPlaywright content series where I&amp;rsquo;ll everything from core testing concepts, to Playwright tools, APIs &amp;amp; best practices for end-to-end testing of modern web applications.
