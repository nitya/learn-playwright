      <description>Getting Started - Part 1  Welcome to Day 1 of #30DaysOfPlaywright!!
 Today&amp;rsquo;s goal is to make progress on the Getting Started tutorial which should get us set up with the Playwright Test runner in our local development environment - and get us configured to do our first test run.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot covered in there, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to break this into multiple parts.
  Part 1: - Install the Playwright Test runner and validate setup by completing your first test run with the sample test script.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Learn About Testing! It&amp;rsquo;s December 1! The new year is just over 30 days away so it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect time to make a learning resolution, get started on it now - and then check it off the very first day of the New Year! So what do you want to learn this year?
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to invest this month exploring a topic that fascinates me - end-to-end testing for modern web apps.</description>
